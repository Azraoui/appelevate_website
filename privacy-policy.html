    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: [Date]</p>

    <p>[Your Organization Name] ("us", "we", or "our") operates the [App Name(s)] mobile applications (the "Service").
    </p>

    <p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data when you use
        our Service and the choices you have associated with that data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>

    <p>Our apps are designed to respect your privacy. We generally do not collect any personally identifiable
        information. However, to provide and improve our Service, we may collect certain information automatically,
        including:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We may collect information about how the Service is accessed and used ("Usage
            Data"). This Usage Data may include information such as your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g., IP
            address), device type, operating system version, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
            diagnostic data.</li>

        <li><strong>Crash Data:</strong> In the event of an app crash, we may collect crash logs to help us identify and
            fix issues. These logs may contain information about your device and the state of the app at the time of the
            crash.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Third-Party Services</h2>

    <p>We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service ("Service Providers"), to provide
        the Service on our behalf, or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>

    <p>These third parties have access to your Usage Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated
        not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

    <p>Our apps may use the following third-party services that may collect information used to identify you:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Google Play Services</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Firebase Analytics</strong> (for anonymous usage statistics)</li>
        <li><strong>AdMob</strong> (if you show ads in your apps)</li>
        <!-- Add any other third-party services you use -->
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cookies</h2>

    <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. Our Service
        does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use
        "cookies" to collect information and improve their services.</p>

    <h2>4. Links to Other Sites</h2>

    <p>Our Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that
        site. Note that these external sites are not operated by us. We strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy
        of these websites.</p>

    <h2>5. Children's Privacy</h2>

    <p>Our Services do not address anyone under the age of 13 ("Children"). We do not knowingly collect personally
        identifiable information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your
        child has provided us with personal data, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>6. GDPR Compliance (For European Users)</h2>

    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the General
        Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We aim to take reasonable steps to allow you to correct, amend, delete, or
        limit the use of your Personal Data.</p>

    <p>If you wish to be informed what Personal Data we hold about you and if you want it to be removed from our
        systems, please contact us.</p>

    <p>In certain circumstances, you have the following data protection rights:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>The right to access:</strong> You have the right to request copies of your personal data.</li>
